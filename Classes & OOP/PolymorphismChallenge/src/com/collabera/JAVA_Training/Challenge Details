***** Polymorphism Challenge Instructions *****

1) We are going to go back to the car analogy
2) Create a base class called Car
3) It should have a few fields that would be appropriate for a generic car class
4) Engine, Cylinders, Wheels, etc....
5) Constructor should initialize cylinders (number of) and name, and set wheels to 4 and engine to true.
6) Cylinder and names would be passed parameters.
7) Create appropriate getters
8) Create some methods like startEngine, accelerate, and brake
9) Show a message for each in the base class
10) Now create 3 sub classes for your favorite vehicles
11) Override the appropriate methods to demonstrate polymorphism in use
12) Put all classes in the one java file
